# Poseidon Project

Always read and follow the coding conventions in [STYLEGUIDE.md](./STYLEGUIDE.md) when writing or modifying C code in this project.

## Git Commit Conventions

- **Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By" lines to commit messages.** All commits should have only the author's information.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "docs:", "test:", "refactor:", "chore:")
- Keep commits focused and atomic - one logical change per commit

## Key Patterns
- Reference-counted structs have `refcounter_t refcounter` as the first member
- Types use `_t` suffix, functions follow `type_action()` naming
- Create functions use `get_clear_memory()` and call `refcounter_init()` last
- Destroy functions check count==0 before freeing
- Directories in `src/` are organized by semantic purpose (Buffer/, Workers/, Time/, etc.)
